<h1><span>Trausteknik Projects</span></h1>
At Trausteknik, I have developed, maintained, and extended client-focused
solutions that streamline their business processes. These solutions primarily
used Salesforce but also incorporated other technologies.
<h2><span>Black and White Waiters</span></h2>
<p>
  I have been pivotal in maintaining and extending the Salesforce-based
  solutions used throughout Black and White Waiters daily. These solutions
  provide an efficient interface for each type of user on the system.
</p>
<p>
  More specifically, while working with the relevant stakeholders and as part of
  a team, I have been able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Respond to changing requirements by extending their rich LWC interfaces so
    management can efficiently coordinate staff rostering.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extend and maintain the mobile user interface used by lower-level staff so
    that they can work well as a team.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement browser-based image resizing for efficient use of images without
    user interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maintaining, extending and improving the web interface for Black and White
    Waiter’s customers.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Social Futures</span></h2>
<p>
  I have been crucial in developing solutions at Social Futures to produce
  compliant output that reduces duplication of effort. I have also maintained
  solutions that ensure the safety of staff. To deliver these solutions, I have
  had to utilise my problem-solving skills to resolve both the limitations of
  the Salesforce platform and integration challenges. I have had to evaluate
  Salesforce’s abilities to determine the most effective technology to deliver
  the solution.
</p>
<p>
  I was part of a team that delivered a solution for collecting and packaging
  welfare data into XML format for submission to a government department. My
  role was developing a form interface that allowed the user to generate the
  required XML accurately. However, over time, the volume of data grew, and I
  needed to refactor how the solution worked to fit within Salesforce’s
  limitations.
</p>
<p>
  I was pivotal during the development of a feature to simplify the collection
  and presentation of “Outcome Star” data. I explored various technologies for
  creating an “Outcome Star” image for inclusion in a Visualforce PDF. However,
  I determined that the most effective approach involved a separate server
  dynamically generating the image. The Salesforce’s PDF generator requested
  this image by passing the data as parameters.
</p>
<p>
  While maintaining an SMS-based check-in system, I used my problem-solving
  skills to increase the system's reliability and, therefore, staff safety. I
  used my troubleshooting skills to re-create a problem to discover the issue.
  The issue was that the SMS integration provided incorrect metadata on the SMS
  if the receiver of the SMS replied to it immediately. Because of the nature of
  the system, I recognised that waiting to reply to the message was an
  unacceptable solution despite its technical validity. Therefore, I developed a
  fix to identify when this occurred and provide the correct behaviour. The
  client has confirmed that the instances of incorrect behaviour have stopped,
  leading to a safe and more reliable check-in system for their staff.
</p>
<h2><span>DirectIT</span></h2>
<p>
  I have been a key developer in developing and maintaining solutions that
  increase DirectIT staff efficiency.
</p>
<p>
  In communication with key stakeholders, and as the primary developer on the
  team, I developed an effective interactive interface for management to assign
  jobs to workers and monitor key metrics. I combined the interface with an
  interface on each job to efficiently track the workers’ attention to their
  task. This reduced the time needed by management and workers to manually
  record and audit their time.
</p>
<p>
  I have also worked on other improvements in DirectIT’s Salesforce system to
  improve system efficiency. My improvements also exposed metrics so that
  management could quickly and clearly understand their business performance.
</p>
<h2><span>Australian Computer Society (ACS)</span></h2>
<p>
  I worked as part of a team to maintain the MySFIA tool that is part of the ACS
  website. My work involved understanding and troubleshooting a non-trivial
  codebase to ensure the tool continued functioning for all users.
</p>
<h2><span>The Growth Faculty</span></h2>
<p>
  I worked to maintain and extend The Growth Faculty’s Salesforce system and
  their PHP-based website, which was integrated with Salesforce as a database.
  Because of my efforts as part of a team, The Growth Faculty could react to the
  changing nature of the types of events they offered.
</p>
<h2><span>Trausteknik</span></h2>
<p>
  I have developed some valuable solutions for internal use at Trausteknik.
  These solutions have provided extra information and time savings to multiple
  members of the Trausteknik team.
</p>
<p>
  One solution I developed that demonstrated my problem-solving and integration
  development skills is importing a Google Doc into Salesforce. The Google Doc
  can have images and diagrams and needs to be imported into Salesforce’s
  rich-text fields for integration into a Visualforce PDF. While initially, I
  built a solution with Salesforce doing the entire interaction with the Google
  Docs API, the lack of an HTML parser destroyed the data consistency and
  integrity. Thus, I developed and integrated a separate service to provide the
  needed functionality. The working solution has saved time for other team
  members who would otherwise spend additional time reformatting documents and
  increased team cohesion as the preferences for how documents were developed
  reduced in significance.
</p>
<p>
  I developed a calendar displaying the number of hours worked in the month.
  While initially meant for my consumption, other team members deemed the
  feature valuable enough to be integrated into the company system.
