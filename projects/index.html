<h2 id="hobbys"><span>Hobby Projects</span></h2>
<h3><span>At Dubbo Presbyterian Church.</span></h3>
<p>I am involved with my local church to help livestreaming and publishing of meetings. I developed the documentation needed for a fast onboarding process and developed a tool to simplify audio postprocessing via ffmpeg. My previous tools enabling simplified post-processing have been written in Python and PHP and enabled simple encoding of church sermons into multiple formats</p>

            <p>I was looking for an easy way for mobile phones to send SMS through MyNetFone, an Australian Voip service Provider. Because there was no program that I could find suitable, I created a program on the android platform (while learning the language) and called it "SMS via MNF.</p>
