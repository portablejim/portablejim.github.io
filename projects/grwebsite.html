<p>As part of a team, I updated the website of <a href="http://globalrecordings.net">http://globalrecordings.net</a> to use
    a new responsive design, including developing a custom forms library and customising a javascript HTML5 player
    to suit the requirements of the organisation. </p>

<h2>Forms Library</h2>
<figure><img title="The main screen" alt="Global Recordings Network website" src="/static/images/programs/grn-form-demo.png" /></figure>
<p>I developed a library that would generate forms from a text config. For example, the above form was generated from the following code. The code included internationalisation keys.</p>
    <pre>
<code>[form]
 type = email
 titleId = stay_informed
 descriptionId = receive_inspiring_stories
 toAddress = @globalrecordings.net
 toPrefix = select_a_country
 fromField = your_email_address
 buttonStringId = sign_up_for_updates
 successId = formdata_success_message
 errorId = errorId
 restrictField = select_a_country

 [fields]
 your_first_name.name = "your_first_name"
 your_first_name.type = "text"
 your_first_name.width = 1
 your_first_name.promptId = "your_first_name"
 your_first_name.required = true
 your_first_name.errorId = "error_field_is_blank"

 your_last_name.name = "your_last_name"
 your_last_name.type = "text"
 your_last_name.width = 1
 your_last_name.promptId = "your_last_name"
 your_last_name.required = true
 your_last_name.errorId = "error_field_is_blank"

 your_email_address.name = "your_email_address"
 your_email_address.type = "email"
 your_email_address.width = 1
 your_email_address.promptId = "your_email_address"
 your_email_address.required = true
 your_email_address.errorId = "error_email_is_blank_or_invalid"

 select_a_country.name = "select_a_country"
 select_a_country.type = "dropdown"
 select_a_country.width = 1
 select_a_country.promptId = "select_a_country"
 select_a_country.required = true
 select_a_country.errorId = "error_field_is_blank"
 select_a_country.options["au"] = "location_35"
 select_a_country.options["mailca"] = "location_61"
 select_a_country.options["ph"] = "location_221"
 select_a_country.options["ch"] = "location_245"
 select_a_country.options["thai"] = "location_248"
 select_a_country.options["uk"] = "location_263"
 select_a_country.options["us"] = "location_265"
</code>
</pre>
<p>The code for the library is <a href="https://github.com/portablejim/FormGenerator">available here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jsplayer">Javascript player</h2>

<p>The existing flash-based player was not adequate for the organisation's needs to play content on many devices, and there was not a library that was able to meet those needs. I updated a plugin for <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/">Mediaelement.js</a> called "Mediaelement playlist plugin" that was abandoned. I fixed the bugs present in it and improved on the plugin to include the features that the organisation required.</p>
<p>The plugin allows an audio playlist to be played, whilst showing an appropriate image for the track.</p>
<p><a href="http://portablejim.github.io/mediaelement-playlist-plugin/index.html">Documentation and code for the plugin</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://test.globalrecordings.net/en/program/C23050">Here</a> is a link to a page on the live website using the plugin.</p>
